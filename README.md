## Connecting to standart lua libary called "lua_shared.dll"
### which is located in {$YourServerDirectory}/garrysmod/bin


Official garry module contains a cut of lua sources. Okaye, restore it.

This sources helps you to create a module for garry's mod without official interface, but with completed lua5.1 official interface. Firstly, you need to convert lua_shared.dll to lua_shared.lib by few basic steps, if you know how to do this, do it like you know. But if you don't know, i'll tell you -> https://adrianhenke.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/create-lib-file-from-dll/

or if you lazy, just use my script https://github.com/help-edu/python-ball/blob/master/convert_to_lib.py
